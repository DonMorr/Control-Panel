Control-Panel
=============
This set of python scripts and Arduino files can be used to grab information from the Telemachus plugin for Kerbal Space Program and display it on a series of 7 segment displays, analog gauges, or a terminal window. It can also read button presses from the arduino and pass them to Telemachus.

Output features:
	-Seven Segment Displays
	-Analog Gauges (5v)
	-Terminal Output

Input Features:
	-Momentary Button (toggle)
	-Keyed Switch 

Input is currently setup for Gear, Light, SAS, RCS, Brake, Stage, Abort, and Safety.

You probably just need to download the following files:  json_processor.py telemachus_plugin.py RocketPanelCombined

The rest of the files are sub-versions that were used for testing different parts of the project.
